    Create an RMS map for a (mostly) arbitrary scanning strategy <Example_RMSmaps.ipynb>
    Find filtered signal peaks, and find observing time for a peak detection of X :math:`\\sigma` for a single pointing <Get_A10_MUSTANG2_numbers.ipynb>
    Allows much more flexibility; (mostly) arbitrary scanning strategies can be performed  <Leightweight_SimObs_A10.ipynb>
    Fitting a spherical cluster model to an input HDU <FitPressureProfile_LW.ipynb>
