Installation
============

``M2-TJ`` is available on `Github <https://github.com/CharlesERomero/M2_TJ>`_ and `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/M2-TJ/>`_. 

 We recommend install the latest version from Github::

    git clone https://github.com/CharlesERomero/M2_TJ.git
    cd M2_TJ
    pip3 install .
    
Installing from GitHub has the advantage of downloading the (example) notebooks, which users should feel free to copy and edit to expedite their use of this package.
    
This package, ``M2-TJ``, is also available through pip::

    pip3 install M2-TJ

The PyPI repository should contain the latest stable release (as judged by the developer), but it will not come with the notebooks.
    
``M2_TJ`` depends on numpy, scipy, astropy, matplotlib, emcee, reproject, and corner
